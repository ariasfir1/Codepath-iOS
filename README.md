## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- The syntax of Swift and the layout of Xcode has a sharp learning curve, but I managed. With persistence and the help of Google, I was able to add some cool features to my app. I had the most trouble manipulating the colors in dark mode and making the party size function operate correctly.
